# MODEL variant modules

`Model_LoadMonsterMerge` loads four more stages per model after the MODEL
primary. Each stage is 10 sectors at `record * 276 + 180`, `+ 190`, `+ 200` and
`+ 210`. Slot 0 loads at `0x8013B000` and slot 1 at `0x8017B000`. This note
calls these images the model variants. Twenty-seven slot-0 images are registered;
see [Registered images](#registered-images).

## Compiler

The helpers registered here were not built with the gcc 2.8.1 that builds the
rest of the game. (The Spanish variant helpers in
`src/overlays/spanish_model_variant/` do match under `gcc_2_8_1_g0_split`, so
this is a statement about these functions, not about every variant.) They end in `addiu $sp, $sp, N; jr $ra; nop`. gcc 2.7.2 emits
that epilogue as reorder-mode text, and the assembler fills the delay slot
with a `nop`. gcc 2.8.1 emits the epilogue as RTL, and reorg moves the stack
adjustment into the slot. For the four header-397 helpers, gcc 2.8.1 output is
one word shorter than the retail function, and 21 to 24 words differ in all.

The `gcc_2_7_2_cdk_g0` profile uses the decompals/old-gcc 0.17
`gcc-2.7.2-cdk` release (`cygnus-2.7.2-970404`), installed by
`make compiler-272-prebuilt` from the pinned
`tools/bootstrap/old_gcc_272_prebuilt.json`. Apart from the compiler path it
is identical to `gcc_2_8_1_g0`: same flags, same maspsx arguments.

Four helper bodies were measured against their retail words with each 2.7.2
build before registration (quad and rings in their header-405 copies, spokes
and sheets under header 397):

| Helper | Instructions | `gcc-2.7.2-cdk` | `gcc-2.7.2-psx` |
|---|---:|---|---|
| quad | 218 | match | 4 words differ |
| rings | 224 | match | 24 words differ |
| spokes | 195 | match | 27 words differ |
| sheets | 314 | match | match |

PsyQ 4.1's `CC1PSX.EXE` (the same `cygnus-2.7.2-970404`) also matches all four,
run under wine.

Negative control: with `gcc_2_8_1_g0` selected, `make match-overlays` fails
for `model_variant_1_pos0_slot0` with "rebuilt module does not match its
input", and each of the four header-397 helpers compiles one word short.
`make overlays` and `make verify-overlays` pass under either profile, because
neither of them compiles C.

## Header families

The first word of a variant image is a header id. Every image with a given
header that has been checked has the same text: the same functions at the same
addresses, byte for byte. Only the data after the text differs. So the C files
are named by header, as the Spanish variant files are
(`src/overlays/spanish_model_variant/variant432_*.c`), and each registered image
of a header reuses them unchanged.

The same helper body also occurs under other headers at other addresses. Those
copies are not byte-identical: the work-area offsets differ. For example, rings
reads its ring array at `ctx + 0x15AC` under header 405 and at `ctx + 0x72C`
under header 397, and quad reads its divisor from `+ 0x20` of a pointed-to
record under header 405 and from `+ 0x24` under header 397. The header-397
rings and quad files are the header-405 sources with those constants replaced,
and the header-418 files are the header-397 ones with theirs replaced; nothing
else changed. Each new header therefore needs its own copy with its own
offsets.

| Header | Text end | C functions | Assembly functions | Images |
|---:|---|---|---:|---:|
| 405 | `0x3850` | rings `0x8013E168`, quad `0x8013E4E8` | 7 | 2 |
| 397 | `0x2DE4` | sheets `0x8013C994`, spokes `0x8013D3F0`, rings `0x8013D6FC`, quad `0x8013DA7C` | 3 | 12 |
| 418 | `0x396C` | spokes `0x8013DF78`, rings `0x8013E284`, quad `0x8013E604` | 6 | 13 |

## Registered images

Model ids follow the compact-record ledger in
[`spanish-model-return-two-instances.csv`](spanish-model-return-two-instances.csv).
The modules are named `model_variant_<model>_<stage>_slot0`. The Spanish
notes tie record sectors 200..209 to loader stage 9, so the `+ 200` images are named `stage9`. The stage that
reads sectors 180..189 has not been confirmed from the loader, so those images
keep the neutral `pos0`.

| Header | Sector offset | Models |
|---:|---|---|
| 405 | `+ 180` | 1, 550 |
| 397 | `+ 180` | 2, 20, 87, 108, 138, 193, 573 |
| 397 | `+ 200` | 152, 168, 170, 388, 427 |
| 418 | `+ 180` | 34, 71, 124, 182, 279, 361, 491, 580, 640 |
| 418 | `+ 200` | 166, 275, 469, 590 |

All images load at `0x8013B000`. Their resident calls resolve to the North
American addresses of the same names and are listed once in
`model_variant_linker_symbols.txt`.
