# Overlay Research

This directory holds project-owned documentation for runtime-loaded code and
its resident load banks.

- [`../../src/overlays/README.md`](../../src/overlays/README.md) defines the
  module-scoped source layout. Runtime overlay C belongs under
  `src/overlays/<module>/`, never in resident `src/game/`.
- [`runtime-loader.md`](runtime-loader.md) records the asynchronous loader,
  archive attribution, load-bank layout, and recovered WA sector packages.
- [`matching-patterns.md`](matching-patterns.md) records the source-shape
  rules recovered while matching overlay functions, and the one residual
  difference that no available compiler profile reproduces.
- [`module-crosswalk.md`](module-crosswalk.md) correlates verified archive
  slices and load ranges with the external per-screen symbol files.
- [`../mrg-files.md`](../mrg-files.md) documents the MRG container evidence and
  development-path strings.
- [`../research/Unchiga_Symbols/modules.md`](../research/Unchiga_Symbols/modules.md)
  is an external reference for screen-module identities and per-module symbol
  files.

Generated resident slot images remain under `tmp/splat/assets/overlays/`; they
are build artifacts rather than tracked overlay sources.

| Content | Repository location | Tracked |
|---|---|---|
| Resident executable C | `src/game/` | Yes |
| Verified runtime module C | `src/overlays/<module>/` | Yes |
| Resident load-slot snapshots | `tmp/splat/assets/overlays/` | No |
| Extracted archive payloads and probes | `tmp/` | No |

## Module build status

Every configured module is extracted from its archive, split by a
module-specific Splat layout, rebuilt, and compared byte-for-byte against the
verified slice by `make match-overlays`.

| Module | Archive | Sectors | Load address | Function inventory |
|---|---|---:|---:|---|
| `free_duel` | `WA_MRG.MRG` | `7898` x5 | `0x80168000` | Yes |
| `password` | `WA_MRG.MRG` | `8054` x15 | `0x80168000` | Yes |
| `overworld_before_coup` | `WA_MRG.MRG` | `8153` x6 | `0x80168000` | Not yet |
| `overworld_after_coup` | `WA_MRG.MRG` | `8311` x6 | `0x80168000` | Not yet |
| `main_menu` | `SU.MRG` | `98` x16 | `0x80180000` | Not yet |

A module joins the build gate once `config/slus_01411/overlays.json` gives it a
`layout`. A `config/slus_01411/overlays/<module>_matching_c.json` then lets
matching C replace part of its generated assembly.

Name entry has no module of its own: its package's executable phase is the
same image as the password screen, entered at different functions. See
[`../../src/overlays/name_entry/README.md`](../../src/overlays/name_entry/README.md).

Per-module decompilation counts are generated into the README progress
section by `tools/project/progress.py`; they are deliberately not duplicated
here.
