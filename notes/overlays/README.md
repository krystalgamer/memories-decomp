# Overlay Research

This directory holds project-owned documentation for runtime-loaded code and
its resident load banks.

- [`../../src/overlays/README.md`](../../src/overlays/README.md) defines the
  module-scoped source layout. Runtime overlay C belongs under
  `src/overlays/<module>/`, never in resident `src/game/`.
- [`runtime-loader.md`](runtime-loader.md) records the asynchronous loader,
  archive attribution, load-bank layout, and recovered WA sector packages.
- [`matching-patterns.md`](matching-patterns.md) records the source-shape
  rules recovered while matching overlay functions, and the one residual
  difference that no available compiler profile reproduces.
- [`recorded-blockers.md`](recorded-blockers.md) explains how to read the
  per-function notes that say why something will not match, and why the
  explanation half of them should be retested rather than trusted.
- [`module-crosswalk.md`](module-crosswalk.md) correlates verified archive
  slices and load ranges with the external per-screen symbol files.
- `tools/project/overlay_diff.py` compares one candidate against the retail
  module bytes without building the module; see below.
- [`../mrg-files.md`](../mrg-files.md) documents the MRG container evidence and
  development-path strings.
- [`../research/Unchiga_Symbols/modules.md`](../research/Unchiga_Symbols/modules.md)
  is an external reference for screen-module identities and per-module symbol
  files.

Generated resident slot images remain under `tmp/splat/assets/overlays/`; they
are build artifacts rather than tracked overlay sources.

| Content | Repository location | Tracked |
|---|---|---|
| Resident executable C | `src/game/` | Yes |
| Verified runtime module C | `src/overlays/<module>/` | Yes |
| Resident load-slot snapshots | `tmp/splat/assets/overlays/` | No |
| Extracted archive payloads and probes | `tmp/` | No |

## Module build status

Every configured module is extracted from its archive, split by a
module-specific Splat layout, rebuilt, and compared byte-for-byte against the
verified slice by `make match-overlays`.

| Module | Archive | Sectors | Load address | Function inventory |
|---|---|---:|---:|---|
| `free_duel` | `WA_MRG.MRG` | `7898` x5 | `0x80168000` | Yes |
| `password` | `WA_MRG.MRG` | `8054` x15 | `0x80168000` | Yes |
| `overworld_before_coup` | `WA_MRG.MRG` | `8153` x6 | `0x80168000` | Not yet |
| `overworld_after_coup` | `WA_MRG.MRG` | `8311` x6 | `0x80168000` | Not yet |
| `main_menu` | `SU.MRG` | `98` x16 | `0x80180000` | Not yet |

A module joins the build gate once `config/slus_01411/overlays.json` gives it a
`layout`. A `config/slus_01411/overlays/<module>_matching_c.json` then lets
matching C replace part of its generated assembly.

Name entry has no module of its own: its package's executable phase is the
same image as the password screen, entered at different functions. See
[`../../src/overlays/name_entry/README.md`](../../src/overlays/name_entry/README.md).

Per-module decompilation counts are generated into the README progress
section by `tools/project/progress.py`; they are deliberately not duplicated
here.

## Diffing one candidate function

`make match-overlays` is the acceptance gate, but it rebuilds and rehashes
every module, which is far too slow to compare source shapes against each
other. `tools/project/overlay_diff.py` compiles a single file and compares
just that function against the bytes already extracted from the retail
module:

```sh
tools/environments/python/bin/python tools/project/overlay_diff.py \
    main_menu 0x801840F8 tmp/candidate.c
```

It reports `MATCH` or prints a numbered side-by-side disassembly with `>>` on
each differing instruction, and exits non-zero on a difference. The source
argument is optional; without it the tool re-checks whatever
`<module>_matching_c.json` already configures — **including that entry's
compiler profile**, since a function built with a non-default profile would
otherwise be spot-checked with the wrong one. `--profile` overrides, and a
candidate passed explicitly defaults to `gcc_2_8_1_g0_split`.

Two details make the comparison trustworthy:

- **Relocated fields are excluded, and only those.** An unlinked object leaves
  every relocated field zero where the module holds the resolved value, so the
  tool reads the object's own relocation table and masks exactly the affected
  bits — the low 16 of a `%hi`/`%lo` pair, the low 26 of a jump. Registers and
  opcodes are still compared in those words.
- **The function is sliced out by symbol.** A source may define a group of
  contiguous functions, so the tool locates the requested one in the object's
  symbol table rather than assuming it starts at offset zero. Slicing by the
  symbol is what guarantees the right function is compared, so a candidate
  whose length does not yet agree with the inventory is still diffed — that is
  the normal state of a function being worked on, and the diff is what shows
  why. The length difference is reported on its own line.

This does not replace `make match-overlays`, which is still what proves a
module reassembles and links. It is what makes it practical to measure several
candidate shapes instead of guessing between them: a probe costs about a fifth
of a second rather than minutes.
