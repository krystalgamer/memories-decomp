/* MATCH 2026-09-05, pure C at default -O2 -G8 with the assembler at -G0
 * (PER_FUNC_AS_FLAGS): D_8009B458 bare through its own register, D_80011434
 * as cc1psx's own pair via $v0. Replaces a transcription (four asm levers:
 * an empty asm launder on the arg1 copy, reloads, pins).
 *
 * The 21 differences the first pure C sat at were ONE mechanism: gcc hoisted
 * arg1's per-iteration `andi` out of the call-bearing loop into a saved
 * register. The loop is written with `goto` (label at the top, conditional
 * `goto top;` at the bottom) because gcc 2.8's loop pass runs only between
 * the LOOP_BEG/LOOP_END notes of for/while/do -- a goto loop has none, so
 * nothing is hoisted, which is what retail shows. Then, in order:
 *   29 -> 22  `a1 = arg1;` named at the top, masked at its use
 *   22 -> 11  `mask = 0;` written before `i = 0;` (13 under -G8/as -G0)
 *   13 ->  5  `do { } while (0);` round the loop's bottom four statements
 *             (the permuter's find; it stops off/tbl rotating)
 *    5 ->  0  `i = 0; mask = 0;` -- two zeroings rather than `i = mask;`;
 *             gcc makes the copy itself and puts it in the guard's delay slot
