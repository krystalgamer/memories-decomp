/* MATCH (2026-09-05). Was an ASSEMBLY TRANSCRIPTION (Unchiga's port of
 * 2026-08-30, an inline asm block) counted as debt in docs/ASM_DEBT.md;
 * this is the C. Flags: -O2 -G0 -mno-split-addresses, as -G0 (gp == 0, the
 * scalar D_8009B458 arm). The full history is in docs/PARKED.txt.
 *
 * Track/tempo-stream setup on D_8009B458: resets the record's stream
 * fields, reads a halfword through SD_ReadSequenceU16BE and a word through
 * SD_ReadSequenceU32BE (its top three bytes are the raw tempo), computes
 * 60000000 / tempo * 100 / 115, clamps it to 0xFF, halves or quarters it by
 * mode (0x1E: >> 2; 0x18 and 0x3C: >> 1) and stores the byte into +0x16 and
 * +0x14 of the record before handing it to SD_ReadSequenceByte.
 *
 * The shape is the D_8009B0F4-family idiom: a `do { } while (0);` (a macro
 * in the original) round the eight statements from the +0x7F0 store to the
 * +0x808 store. The last three levers, in order: a base local `b` loaded
 * BEFORE the byte store through the pointee, so the +0x518 store goes
 * through the pre-store base while everything after the `sb` reloads;
 * the dividend named inside the pin (`k = 60000000;`); the call result
 * routed through the later result name (`v = call >> 8; r = v;`), which
 * puts the whole reciprocal block in retail's order; and finally the
 * +0x7F0 store moved INSIDE the pin, which is what forms `p` and copies it
 * into $a0 before the two word stores -- the permuter found that last one
 * at score 0 after 13 -> 7 by hand. Every one of these was measured as
 * worthless or worse while an earlier fault was still open.
