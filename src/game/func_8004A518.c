/* MATCH 2026-09-05, pure C at default -O2 -G8 with the assembler at -G0
 * (PER_FUNC_AS_FLAGS). Replaces a transcription (asm reloads, register pins,
 * scheduling fences). Three loops of constant stores over D_8009B458 records
 * and one batch key-on of the OR-ed keys.
 *
 * Levers, in the order the residue gave them up:
 *   +2 -> 0/51  loop 2 (the one with calls) as a `goto` loop: gcc 2.8's loop
 *               pass runs only between for/while/do notes, so the literal 0x63
 *               is no longer hoisted into a seventh saved register
 *   51 -> 27    one pointer name per loop (r1, r3) rather than one `r`
 *   27 -> 20    loop 2 addressed off `base` itself, reloaded at the bottom
 *   20 -> 17    `tbl++; off += 0x28;` after the SpuSetKey call
 *   17 -> 16    loop-3 constants named at their store widths (u8, u8, s32)
 *   16 -> 11    default -G8 / as -G0: D_80011434 as cc1psx's own pair
 *   11 ->  2    `do { } while (0);` round loop 2's guarded block (permuter;
 *               decomposed from a pin round the whole middle of the function)
 *    2 ->  0    the record address written INLINE at each store, `(base +
 *               off)[k]`, instead of assigned to base first (permuter): the
 *               CSE'd sum is scheduled after the call argument's copy, where
 *               a cursor assignment was scheduled before it.
